# This is a motor controller 
## Based on the repository of Josh Newans at https://github.com/joshnewans/ros_arduino_bridge
## Some differences between my development and Josh's code
- Based on raspberry pico (vs Arduino nano)
- The ros2 node is inside raspberry pico (vs Raspberry pi)
- Conexion is trough micro-ros-agent (vs serial)
- I use the Motor Driver DRV8833 (vs LM328)

## Status of the code: **In progress**
